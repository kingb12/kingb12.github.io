I'm a third year PhD student in Natural Language Processing, working with [Prof. Jeffrey Flanigan](https://jflanigan.github.io/).
My research is focused on dialogue understanding, interactive systems, few-shot NLP methods, and continual learning.

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Apptio](https://apptio.com), and before that a computational research intern at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://isbscience.org/), where I helped develop methods for automatic metabolic reconstruction of microbes with [Prof. Nathan Price](https://isbscience.org/bio/nathan-price/).
I also completed my BS in computer science at University of Washington.
Outside of work and research I enjoy hiking, mountaineering, skiing and otherwise being outdoors!
